    Primary access to the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) alert stream is
    planned to be via endpoints accessed through "community brokers".
    Community brokers are likely to provide additional services, e.g.
    enriching alerts with additional data from other catalogs or providing event
    classification, and to allow end-users to filter these enriched alerts.
    Supplementary to these community brokers, the LSST will provide a basic
    alert filtering service with limited capacity.
    The service will only allow access to the contents of each alert, i.e., no
    outside information can be used in a filter.

    The Data Products Definition Document (LSE-163) describes how end-users
    will build filters.
    End-users will be able to write filters using simple code (likely written
    as Python functions) or SQL-like queries.
    The Data Management Systems Requirements document (LSE-61) gives the
    requirements for the alert filtering service, namely DMS-REQ-0342
    (existence of filtering service), DMS-REQ-0348 (pre-defined filters),
    and DMS-REQ-0343 (performance requirements).
    The filtering service is expected to support ``numBrokerUsers`` = 100
    simultaneous connected users each allocated a bandwidth capable of
    receiving ``numBrokerAlerts`` = 20 full alerts per visit.
